<p> Mahendra Singh Dhoni, a native of Jharkhand, rose through the ranks to play for India in international cricket. His story is one of defiance, amazing talent, tenacity, and, above all, faith. When Dhoni was discovered as a wicketkeeper by his school's P.E. teacher, he raised eyebrows since he was a young man with no discernible upper-body strength who was hitting boundaries against some of the greatest fast bowlers in the region. He struggled to compete against candidates from the wealthier A-tier states, hence the system failed him. As a result, in an effort to make ends meet, he joined the Railways Ranji squad and began working as a ticket collector at the Kharagpur railway station.</br></br></br>
   
  However, in a few months, the universe began to work in favour of the precocious wonderchild from Ranchi. The BCCI launched a nationwide Training Research Development Wing to explore talent from the poorer states after being inspired by the KSCA. Dhoni attracted the scouts' attention right away and was sent on an A tour to Kenya, where he displayed his talent in front of the world while playing against top-notch bowlers in unusual settings. He gained national recognition very quickly and was chosen for the tour of Bangladesh in November 2004. Dhoni's Indian career got off to a rough start as he scored a duck in his first ODI. </br></br></br>
  By that point, he was a broad 22-year-old with long locks. But the selectors and the captain at the time, Sourav Ganguly, chose to stick with him and give him more time. In his fifth ODI against Pakistan, who undoubtedly didn't see the butchery coming, Dhoni paid back their faith with a demonstration of his charisma and bold stroke-play. He butchered his way to 148 at Vishakhapatnam. Later in 2005, he took things a step further by battering his way to a ruthless 183* in Jaipur to dismantle a 300-run chase against a Sri Lankan assault that appeared shocked by his odd-but-effective stroke-play. With a style that worked against pace, seam, swing, and spin, Dhoni became a dependable batsman in Test matches as teams from across the world struggled to figure out how to avoid his fireworks. He coincidentally produced another 148 against Pakistan in his fifth Test, making an uncharacteristically calm effort to win the game and demonstrating his versatility as a batter. After trying a number of wicketkeeper-batsmen, Dhoni had finally established himself as a mainstay in the team.</br></br></br>Wool bustier dresses leaned slightly off-kilter in one direction, in motion.
  He was a strong pinch-hitter towards the end of the innings who could contribute more than just cameos and a more-than-reliable wicketkeeper. Dhoni grew up playing tennis ball cricket competitions in a state when leather ball cricket was a luxury. He created a bottomhand-dominated style using hefty Kashmir willow bats, light and hollow tennis balls, and lengthy boundaries to impart the most power possible to the light tennis ball, which experiences energy-damping upon impact. Dhoni, however, stood out when he and a mate created a body-weight shot that was lifted with an exaggerated follow-through and easily passed boundaries. In that regard, MS Dhoni will go down in cricket mythology as the player who had the audacity to hit the "helicopter shot" against a leather ball.
