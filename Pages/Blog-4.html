<p>Hyderabadi Biryani, the word alone should get your taste buds tingling and your jaws aching with sweet pain. And if it’s not like this, you haven't yet had the Best Hyderabadi Dum Biryani.
    Biryani has been a part of Hyderabadi cuisine tradition for nearly 400 years. It is believed to have been served directly from Persia. “Dum” is a technique where the meat and spices are layered with rice, then cooked in a tightly sealed pot. The rice becomes infused with all the simmering flavors. This unique process ensures that the rice absorbs all the juiciness & spices and brings you that classic “melt in your mouth” gourmet experience.
    
    Hyderabadi Biryani is ordered as a main course by most of the Hyderabadi people at any typical restaurant. It serves as an ideal dish for any gathering, be it with friends, family or colleagues. For starters, there is zafrani – a high-cuisine biryani rich in saffron & spices. Then there is sofiyani, a light, milder tasting biryani that‘s known for its bright white color & status as a closely guarded recipe known by a very select few. Some of the other popular Hyderabadi biryani types include Doodh Ki biryani, Bhatkali biryani, Tahari biryani, cheesy corn biryani, and aloo dum biryani.
     
    From an army ration to a delicacy fit for kings, Hyderabadi biryani has come a long way & is now a pan-India favorite.
