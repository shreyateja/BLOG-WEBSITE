                        <p>Cristiano Ronaldo Das Santos Aveiro is the full name of Cristianois the full name of Cristiano. His second name, Ronaldo, was chosen in honor of his father's favorite actor, Ronald Reagan, who later served as President of the United States. As a young child, he lacked tools because he was born into poverty. His mother is a cook, and his father worked as a kit man at a nearby club. </br></br></br>
When Ronaldo was a student, he was expelled from school for throwing a chair at his instructor. He admitted that the instructor had treated him disrespectfully when questioned about the cause of his rage. Ronaldo's parents made the decision to pursue a sporting career when he was just 10 years old. His father enrolled him in a juvenile club, where he worked as a kit man and gardener. </br></br></br>
From 1992 to 1995, Ronaldo was a member of the amateur team Andorinha. He then spent the following two years playing for Nacional. At the age of 12, Ronaldo went on a three-day trial with Sporting and was signed for £1,500 by the team. The championship for under-18 players featured Ronaldo and his buddy Albert. For the title, only the highest scorer was to be chosen. Up until the last game, Ronaldo and Albert shared the lead in goals scored. After scoring his first goal, Albert took advantage. Ronaldo continued. </br></br></br>
Albert and the goalie found themselves one-on-one once more. He passed the ball to Ronaldo, who scored and was chosen for the team, as opposed to scoring himself. After impressing his manager with his dribbling abilities at the age of 16, Ronaldo was drafted into Sporting's first squad. He became the first player in the club's history to play for the first team, the B team, and the under-16, under-17, and under-18 teams all in the same season. The best teams in Europe began to want to sign Ronaldo. </br></br></br>

He was sought after by Liverpool, Barcelona, Real Madrid, and Arsenal, among others. At that time, Real Madrid was willing to pay the maximum price for Ronaldo. On Ferguson's insistence, United paid an additional £1 million, as well as the guarantee that if they accepted a bid for Ronaldo, they would first have to return him to Sporting for the same fee. Ronaldo wore the iconic No. 7 shirt at Manchester United, which had previously been worn by Eric Cantona, George Best, and David Beckham. Cristiano initially favored wearing the number 28 jersey, but Alex Ferguson insisted that he wear the number 7 jersey instead. Even today, he is regarded as the greatest United player to ever wear this illustrious jersey. </br></br></br>
Cristiano Ronaldo became the first Portuguese player to ever represent Manchester United. Ronaldo's success is credited in large part to Alex Ferguson's mentoring. "He's been my father in sports, one of the most significant and influential factors in my career," he later remarked. When Ronaldo made his Premier League debut at Old Trafford, the audience applauded him by standing up. He replaced Nicky Butt at the 60-second mark. It was "unquestionably the most exciting debut," according to George Best, who praised it. Cristiano made his debut for the senior team against Kazakhstan on August 20, 2003, at the age of 18. </br></br></br>
On October 29, 2005, Ronaldo scored Manchester United's 1000th Premier League goal. Ronaldo and Ruud van Nilsterooy got into a physical altercation on the ground, and Van Nilsterooy ordered Ronaldo to "go crying to your dad," a reference to assistant manager Carlos Queiroz. Given that Ronaldo's father had recently passed away from liver failure, it was particularly harsh. During the England vs. Portugal game during the 2006 World Cup, Ronaldo was involved in an incident that resulted in Wayne Rooney being dismissed. The England fans mistook his wink, and he was questioned on TV and throughout England as a result. </br></br></br>
After the incident, Ronaldo made a public request for a transfer, but Alex Ferguson encouraged him to remain at the club. Ronaldo's one-on-one training sessions with René Meulensteen, who taught him to be unpredictable, enhance his teamwork, call for the ball, and capitalize on goal-scoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically pleasing goals that have become his signature, were a key component of his incredible success as a player. Against Iran during the 2006 World Cup game, Cristiano got his first World Cup goal. During the 2006–07 season, Ronaldo scored his first Champions League goal in the quarterfinals. </br></br></br>

Cristiano became the first Portuguese player to score in three World Cups with his goal against Ghana, which was also his 50th international goal.</br></br></br>

As of the commencement of the 2015–16 season, Ronaldo was Real Madrid's all-time leading scorer in the league and later in all competitions. Ronaldo also broke Raul's mark for most goals scored in the Champions League and surpassed Lionel Messi's total of 77 goals. </br></br></br>
In the 2015–16 season, Cristiano also got his 500th goal overall for club and nation. In the 2016 Club World Cup final, Cristiano scored a hat-trick.

Cristiano Ronaldo acknowledged that this World Cup will likely be his final as he intends to stop playing football when he turns 40.

In November, Ronaldo inked a $21.2 million, two-year contract with Al Nassr after leaving Manchester United on a free transfer. Three days ago, he was revealed in Riyadh, and ever since then, Al Nassr's Instagram followers have skyrocketed from 853k to well over 10 million.
