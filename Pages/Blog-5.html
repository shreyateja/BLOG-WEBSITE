<p> After NY, London and Milan, we’re on the final stop of our fashion world tour in Paris, as stunning collections were coming out of the city of light and love for Autumn Winter Collection 2023. Paris Fashion Week took place from February 27th to March 7th, closing fashion month with a bang. 
    Once again, IFM opened Paris Fashion Week on February 27th, 2023 with its MA Fashion Design Graduate Show, for the first time in the form of a physical show on the IFM campus. It presented the collections of 25 students of the Master of Arts in Fashion Design and Knitwear Design.

    The back-to-back runways of Paris Fashion Week are frenetic. Private cars snake blocks, snared traffic is normal and crowds of photographers make it difficult to navigate the pavements around show venues.
    The labour strikes across France on Tuesday left chunks of front row seats empty at Miu Miu. Chanel, which last season shut out VIP guests who arrived a couple of minutes late, started its show late.
